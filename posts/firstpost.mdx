Hey everyone!
We've made our own website so you don't even need WhatsApp to check out newest Nintendo news!
It's being operated by a group named Pigsqueek.

## What about the WhatsApp channel?
***
Nothing is happening to the WhatsApp channel. In fact, it's still the main way we distribute our news.
The point of our service is so you can see quick Nintendo news, and WhatsApp makes sense for that.
We have this website just for the users who don't use WhatsApp, but want to see the same news.

## Follow us on WhatsApp
Even though we have a website, it is HIGHLY recommended to use our WhatsApp news channel for the quickest news regarding Nintendo.
That's because an important part of the WhatsApp Nintendo News Service is to give you the news quickly as possible and not having to worry
about websites and articles. It may take long until the news from the WhatsApp channel are put here, so if you want the news quickly
as possible, follow the WhatsApp channel.
